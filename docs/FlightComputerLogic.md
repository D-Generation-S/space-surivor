## Commanded Velocity

The commanded velocity you return to the movement script does have two components.

### X Component

A negative x component will strafe the ship to the left, while a positive one will strafe it to the right.

### Y Component

A negative Y component will accelerate the ship while a negative one will decelerate it.
