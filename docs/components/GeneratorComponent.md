# Generator

The power generator of your ship. It does provide a fixed amount of power per tick. This will be used to power components of your ship.

If you do produce more energy than it is used it will try to store the energy in [batteries][battery-component] installed on the ship

Check the [Power Mechanic][power-mechanic] for more information.
