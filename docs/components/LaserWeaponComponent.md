# Laser Weapon

A laser weapon will fire a bunch of lasers in the direction your ship points at. Those projectile do have a spread which makes aiming harder. A laser weapon does always produce some [heat][heat-mechanic] and consumes some [energy][power-mechanic], even if not used. To get rid of this you need to disable them.

The consumption and heat production will increase as soon as you fire the laser.
